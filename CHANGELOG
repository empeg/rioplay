Version 0.29alpha1 (08/21/02)
    - Reorganized directories and class structures
        - Playlists/ now contains a generic playlist class which is
          responsible for the master playlist
        - Sources/ directory contains most of what used to be in
          Playlists/ which are now just classes that provide entries
          to the master playlist
        - Separated AudioThread into a separate class for audio output
          (AudioOutputDevice) and classes for decoding various audio
          formats (currently FlacDecoder and Mp3Decoder)
    - Decoder thread is now created each time a song is played so that
      the right type of decoder can be created depending on the song type
    - Added FLAC support (requires JReceiver to serve up flac files)
    - Added stopwatch icon for when the Rio is busy so the user knows
      something's going on
    - Master playlist: now, when you select music from the "Select Music"
      menu, it is enqueued in the master playlist.  This means you can
      enqueue a few songs from the Rio server, then a Shoutcast stream,
      then some more Rio server songs, etc. and advance through them
      all while they're playing
    - If something is already playing when you select some more music,
      since it is enqueued in the playlist, playback will no longer jump
      to the newly enqueued music.  If you want to start playing it right
      away, clear the playlist first by selecting "Clear Active Playlist"
      under the Audio Receiver menu.  In the future a feature will be
      added which will allow you to press "play" when selecting music
      to cause it to overwrite the current playlist instead of enqueueing
      it
    - Auto off for the backlight seems to be flaky right now.  It doesn't
      always go off.  My only thought right now is that for some reason
      the Remote thread isn't becoming active.  Maybe due to too much load?
    - Added support for C++ new() and delete() operators to the memory
      allocation debug code (which is disabled by default).
    - Converted a lot of areas that used C strings to the C++ string class
      which cleaned up the code a lot.  There's still more C to C++ conversion
      work to do though.
    - Modified init so it is no longer dependent on the system() call which
      means we no longer need a shell in the .arf file which eliminates
      the extra process that was running on the box.

Version 0.28 (07/18/02)
    - Player now comes out of pseudo power down mode in STOP mode instead
      of PLAY mode
    - Support for sample rates of other than 44.1kHz and for mono mode
    - Added a logging mechanism which can be accessed by a web browser
      pointed at the Rio's IP address
    - Added separate input buffer thread which should eliminate the breaks
      in playback of streaming audio
    - Display backlight now powers off after 30 seconds without a keypress

Version 0.24 (07/11/02)
    - Knob on front panel now is used to scroll up and down in menus
    - streams.cfg supported in both Unix and DOS text file formats
    
Version 0.23 (07/04/02)
    - Initial release
